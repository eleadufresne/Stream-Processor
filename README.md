# Overview
 This is a windowed stream processing for monitoring fruit tree images from a directory.

# Requirements
You will need to clone this repository into the home directory of your UNIX-like systems, including Linux, Mac OS X, 
and [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) (for Windows) and ensure that Apache Flink is installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/eleadufresne/fruit-stream-processor.git
```
Flink is compatible with all To run Flink, it's essential to have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed 
on your system. You can verify the installed version by executing `$ java -version` in your command prompt. Follow this 
[tutorial](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/try-flink/local_installation/#first-steps) to get 
started with Flink. ðŸ™ƒ

# Configuration
Please keep in mind the following steps when setting up Cygwin. If you're using a different environment, you may need 
to make some additional configurations. 

## Environment

To begin with, ensure that you've installed the latest Flink distribution, mintty and netcat. Then, navigate to the 
Cygwin folder and locate the ```.bash_profile``` file in the home directory. Add the two lines provided below to the 
end of the file and save it:

```shell
export SHELLOPTS
set -o igncr
```
These commands ensure proper handling of command line arguments in all child processes and normal behavior of the 
carriage return when executing a command in Cygwin.

Next, download the latest Flink distribution and open the flink-conf.yaml file. Add the following line to the end of the file:

```shell
taskmanager.resource-id: stream-processing-logs
```
Flink will create a temporary folder under Cygwin with the given name to maintain its state logs as it sets up a cluster.

## Database
To create the database, you need to make sure that MySQL is installed in your system. If not, follow these instructions 
before proceeding.
First, open the Cygwin terminal and navigate to the cygwin-installer directory by typing 
``cd /cygdrive/c/Users/elea/cygwin-installer`` in the prompt and replace 'elea' with your username.
Now, install MySQL by running the following command: ``./setup-x86_64.exe --packages mysql,mysql-server --quiet-mode``.
Once the installation is completed, set up the database by running ``mysql_install_db``. This will initialize the 
default database.

# Running the Application

To run the app, you must first create database to store the output. We first need to create a database . Start the MySQL 
server and Log in to MySQL as root, create a new user with privileges to access all databases. Then, log out of MySQL 
and log back in as the newly created user. Finally, create a new database with appropriate schema (a table named 
oranges with columns feature and count)

```mysql
# start the MySQL server
mysqld_safe & 
# log into MySQL as root
mysql -u root
# create a new db user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'oranges';
# log out of MySQL
\q
# log in as the newly created user, and type in the password (oranges)
mysql -u user -p
# create a new database
CREATE DATABASE fruits;
# create a table inside the database
USE fruits
CREATE TABLE oranges
(
    feature         VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,               # feature of the orange (ripe, rotten, etc.)
    count           INT unsigned NOT NULL,               # number of such oranges
    PRIMARY KEY     (feature)                            # make the feature the primary key
);
```

From the root directory of your UNIX-like system, execute the following commands.

```shell
# start a cluster
cd flink* && ./bin/start-cluster.sh
# generate a JAR file for the Flink job
cd ../fruit* && mvn clean package && cd ../flink* 
# start monitoring the files in the "data" directory
./bin/flink run ../fruit*/tar*/fruit*.jar --path data/
```
Some example files are provided in the util folder for monitoring. You now visualize the job on the Flink dashboard 
on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

When you are done, stop the cluster with`./bin/stop-cluster.sh` and shut down the MySQL server with 
``mysqladmin --user root shutdown``.

# Common Issues

If you encounter a `java.nio.file.FileSystemException`, it could mean that the task-executor wasn't stopped properly. 
To get around this issue, you can use the Resource Monitor on Windows to find out which process is using the file:

1. Open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
2. Go to the "Performance" tab.
3. Click on "Open Resource Monitor" at the bottom.
4. In the Resource Monitor, navigate to the "CPU" tab.
5. Expand the "Associated Handles" section.
6. Type in the name of the file you're looking for in the search box.
7. Terminate any processes that are using the file.

This should resolve the `java.nio.file.FileSystemException` error.
